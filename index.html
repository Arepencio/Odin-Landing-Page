                    Our great planet Earth is home of many amazing living beings, from the ones that can live in the land to those who can live deep in the water. But one that most people don't talk about are those who are always with us, silently watching. And they are known as THE PLANTS!

        <blockquote>"I tried to make a plant-themed site because i like the color green and the first green color thing i thought of was the plants. I was thinking of looking for some speech about plants from someone important or use Lorem Ipsum, but i decided to put something by myself. I apologize for grammatic, as English is not my native language. But wait... who's saying this?"</blockquote>
